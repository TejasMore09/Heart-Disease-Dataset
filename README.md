# Heart-Disease-Dataset
In this task, I explored tree-based machine learning models for classification, Decision Trees and Random Forests using Scikit-learn. The objective was to understand how these models work, how to interpret them, and how to evaluate their performance using different techniques.
The dataset used for this task was a heart disease dataset (heart.csv) which contains medical attributes of patients. After loading and preprocessing the data, I separated the features and the target variable and then split the data into training and testing sets.
I first trained a Decision Tree Classifier on the training data. To understand how the tree made decisions, I visualized it using Graphviz, which provided a clear flow of how the model splits the data based on different features. I also evaluated its performance on the test data to get the accuracy score. To address overfitting, I pruned the tree by setting the max_depth and min_samples_leaf parameters. This helped simplify the tree and improved its ability to generalize to unseen data.
Next, I trained a Random Forest Classifier, which is an ensemble of multiple decision trees. The Random Forest showed better accuracy and more stable results compared to a single decision tree. 
Finally, to ensure the robustness of the models, I evaluated both the Decision Tree and Random Forest using 5-fold cross-validation. This gave me a better understanding of how the models would perform on different subsets of data and helped prevent overfitting.
The repository includes the dataset, the Jupyter notebook containing all the code and visualizations, the decision tree visualization file (heart_tree.pdf), and this README file.
